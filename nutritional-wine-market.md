<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nutritional Wine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Soak</li><li>Hot Dip</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nutritional wine market can be categorized into two main types: cold soak and hot dip. The cold soak process involves fermenting wine at lower temperatures, enhancing flavor extraction and maintaining freshness, making it ideal for preserving the fruit character. In contrast, the hot dip method involves heating the grapes briefly before fermentation, which helps to extract color and tannins quickly, resulting in a fuller-bodied wine. Both methods contribute to different flavor profiles and nutritional attributes in wines.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cone Penetrometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hand Operated Static Cone Penetrometer</li><li>Self-Start Static Cone Penetrometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cone penetrometer market is primarily divided into two types: hand-operated static cone penetrometers and self-start static cone penetrometers. Hand-operated models require manual force to push the cone into the ground, allowing for detailed soil analysis in various conditions. In contrast, self-start models are equipped with motorized systems, facilitating easier and more consistent penetration, particularly in harder soils. Both types are essential for geotechnical investigations, enabling accurate measurement of soil resistance and providing critical data for construction and engineering projects.</p></p>

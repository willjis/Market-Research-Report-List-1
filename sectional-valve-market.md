<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sectional Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sectional Directional Valves</li><li>Proportional Directional Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sectional valve market encompasses two main types: sectional directional valves and proportional directional valves. Sectional directional valves are designed to control the direction of fluid flow in hydraulic systems, offering fixed flow paths for various operations. In contrast, proportional directional valves provide more precise control by varying the flow rate and direction based on input signals. This allows for smoother and more controlled movement in applications such as industrial machinery and mobile equipment, enhancing overall system performance and efficiency.</p></p>

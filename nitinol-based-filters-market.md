<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitinol based Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent IVC Filters</li><li>Retrievable IVC Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nitinol-based filters are essential in the management of venous thromboembolism and come in two primary types: permanent and retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters. Permanent IVC filters are designed for long-term placement, providing continuous protection against pulmonary embolism. In contrast, retrievable IVC filters offer a temporary solution, allowing for removal after the risk of clot formation diminishes. Both types utilize Nitinol's unique properties, ensuring flexibility and biocompatibility while effectively filtering blood clots from the venous system.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent borne</li><li>Waterborne</li><li>Powder-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Epoxy coatings are classified into three primary types: solvent-borne, waterborne, and powder-based. Solvent-borne epoxy coatings contain organic solvents, offering excellent adhesion and durability but may emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Waterborne epoxy coatings utilize water as the primary solvent, reducing VOC emissions and being more environmentally friendly while still providing good performance. Powder-based epoxy coatings are applied as dry powder, offering a high solid content and minimal waste, making them suitable for industrial applications and producing a smooth, durable finish.</p></p>
